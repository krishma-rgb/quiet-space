      Hey,<br>
      I wrote this page so that whenever you feel like opening it, you can.
      <br><br>

      I just want you to know that, Divya, I can be a real mess sometimes.
      I know I have hurt you when you were already going through your own things,
      and I am truly sorry for that.
      I am trying to improve myself, and I promise that I will always try
      to make you happy.
      <br><br>

      Divya, I don’t know about other universes or other lives,
      but if you believe in them, then I believe in them too.
      And if there is another life,
      I will wait for the one where we can meet again.
      <br><br>

      You deserve everything, Divya.
      Anyone would love a sweet soul like yours,
      so please never hurt yourself because of someone like me.
      You are my sunshine — beautiful like sunlight passing through glass,
      a light that adds color to people’s lives.
      You are precious, and I will always care about you.
      <br><br>

      I love how ambitious you are and how deeply you think about your future.
      That is one of the things I admire most about you.
      I have always been drawn to people who are goal-oriented,
      and that quality in you means a lot to me.
      <br><br>

      I know I have hurt you quite a lot over the past year,
      and I will try my best to make up for it.
      And no matter what happens,
      even if I don’t exist in this world tomorrow,
      I will always be there for you —
      I don’t know how, but I will.
      <br><br>

      Please, always stay happy.
    </p>
